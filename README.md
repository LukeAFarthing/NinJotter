## Background
This game was a collaborative effort put together by me and my amazing team. We wanted to create a 2d platformer that embodied the idea of what it felt like to be a Ninja Otter. It was mostly Luke Farthing's idea, but it resonated with the rest of us so we had to see it through. 
## Installation
To run this project you will need to have GameMaker Studio installed on your computer. Install GameMaker and then clone the Repo from this address: https://github.com/LukeAFarthing/NinJotter. Once that is done open up GameMaker, click on the game and run it straight from the game files!
